import TypingEffect from "~/components/demo/typing-effect.tsx";

The typing animation effect is a very popular effect on the web. It can be used to create a chat, a loading animation, or just to add a bit of dynamism to your website.

Since OpenAI has released ChatGPT (already almost a year!), we can see this effect more than ever. For a project, I had to create a similar effect, and I thought it would be a good idea to share it with you.

### The effect
<br />
<TypingEffect duration={50} isTypeByLetter />

### The code

For this effect, we will use a custom hook:

```tsx title="hooks/use-typing-effect.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

const useTypingEffect = (
  text: string,
  duration: number,
  isTypeByLetter = false,
) => {
  const [currentPosition, setCurrentPosition] = React.useState(0);
  const items = isTypeByLetter ? text.split("") : text.split(" ");

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setCurrentPosition(0);
  }, [text]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (currentPosition >= items.length) return;

    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setCurrentPosition((prevPosition) => prevPosition + 1);
    }, duration);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }, [currentPosition, items, duration]);

  return items.slice(0, currentPosition).join(isTypeByLetter ? "" : " ");
};

export default useTypingEffect;
```

We have 3 parameters: the text to display, the duration between each letter/word, and a boolean to know if we want to type by letter or by word (I use this in the next section).

In our example below we use the hook like with a texts array, and we change the text every 5 seconds, like this:

```tsx title="typing-effect.tsx"
import React from "react";

import useTypingEffect from "~/hooks/use-typing-effect";

const texts = [
  "This is a simple text typing effect in React",
  "This effect is created using React Hooks",
  "We can use this effect to create a typing effect for our portfolio",
  "We can also use this effect to create a typing effect for our resume",
  "or for your blog",
  "or for your landing page",
  "let's go",
];

type TextTypingEffectProps = {
  isTypeByLetter?: boolean;
  duration?: number;
};

const TextTypingEffectWithTexts: React.FC<TextTypingEffectProps> = ({
  isTypeByLetter = false,
  duration = 200,
}) => {
  const [textIndex, setTextIndex] = React.useState(0);
  const textToShow = useTypingEffect(
    texts[textIndex]!,
    duration,
    isTypeByLetter,
  );

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTextIndex((prevIndex) =>
        prevIndex >= texts.length - 1 ? 0 : prevIndex + 1,
      );
    }, 5000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <span className="text-black dark:text-white" key={textIndex}>
      {textToShow}
    </span>
  );
};

export default TextTypingEffectWithTexts;
```
