import TextRevealAnimation from "~/components/demo/text-reveal-animation";

The way text appears on your website can greatly influence user engagement and overall aesthetic appeal. I want to explore a simple text reveal animation that can be used to add a bit of flair to your website. Let's dive into a simple, cool, text reveal animation.
<br />
<TextRevealAnimation />

### Vanilla CSS

```jsx
const TextRevealCSS = () => {
  const text = "Text Reveal Animation ðŸ’«";

  return (
    <h1>
      {text.match(/./gu)!.map((char, index) => (
        <span
          key={`${char}-${index}`}
          style={{ animationDelay: `${index * 0.05}s` }}
        >
          {char === " " ? "\u00A0" : char}
        </span>
      ))}
    </h1>
  );
};
```
```css
h1 {
  overflow: hidden;
  font-size: 2rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.2;
  color: white;
}

span {
  display: inline-block;
  animation: reveal 1.5s cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1) 0.5s;
  animation-fill-mode: backwards;
}

@keyframes reveal {
  0% {
    transform: translate(0, 100%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translate(0, 0);
  }
}
```

### Tailwind CSS

```jsx
export const TextRevealTW = () => {
  const text = "Text Reveal Animation ðŸ’«";

  return (
    <>
      <h1 className="overflow-hidden text-2xl font-bold leading-6 text-white">
        {text.match(/./gu)!.map((char, index) => (
          <span
            className="animate-text-reveal inline-block [animation-fill-mode:backwards]"
            key={`${char}-${index}`}
            style={{ animationDelay: `${index * 0.05}s` }}
          >
            {char === " " ? "\u00A0" : char}
          </span>
        ))}
      </h1>
    </>
  );
};
```
```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        "text-reveal": "text-reveal 1.5s cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1) 0.5s",
      },
      keyframes: {
        "text-reveal": {
          "0%": {
            transform: "translate(0, 100%)",
          },
          "100%": {
            transform: "translate(0, 0)",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Code breakdown
Here is the code breakdown:

- The `<h1>` tag contains the text to be animated. The string from the text variable is broken down into an array of characters with `text.match(/./gu)`. It splits the string into an array of Unicode grapheme clusters (which includes emojis too). Each character is then mapped to a `<span>` element. This allows each letter to have its own animation.
- Animation Delay: For each `<span>` element (each character of the text), the style attribute `animationDelay` is applied. This causes each character to animate at slightly different times, creating a cascading effect. The delay for each character is determined by its index in the array, multiplied by 0.05 seconds.
- White Space Handling: When mapping each character to a `<span>`, we replace any whitespace characters with a non-breaking space ("\u00A0") to preserve spaces in the output.
- CSS Styles: The h1 rule sets the text styling. Each span is displayed inline-block (meaning they line up horizontally), and the animation is applied to it.
- The `@keyframes` reveal defines the animation. At the start (0%), each character is translated 100% down along the Y-axis (which moves it out of view if the overflow is hidden). By the end of the animation (100%), it is back to its original position (Y translation is 0).
- The animation-fill-mode: backwards rule ensures that the elements are in their starting positions before the animation begins.
