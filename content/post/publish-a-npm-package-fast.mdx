## Basic setup

First let's create a `package.json` file in the root of the project. Then paste the following.
```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "test_npm_package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Then we will create an entry point file `index.ts`. Now let's install `typescript` as a dev dependency by running.
```sh
npm i --save-dev typescript
```

After that done we have to initialize our project for typescript.
```sh
npx tsc --init
```

It will create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of the project with alot of configuration options. We will only use these options for now.
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016" /* Set the JavaScript language version for emitted JavaScript and include compatible library declarations. */,
    "module": "commonjs" /* Specify what module code is generated. */,
    "esModuleInterop": true /* Emit additional JavaScript to ease support for importing CommonJS modules. This enables 'allowSyntheticDefaultImports' for type compatibility. */,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true /* Ensure that casing is correct in imports. */,
    "strict": true /* Enable all strict type-checking options. */,
    "skipLibCheck": true /* Skip type checking all .d.ts files. */,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noEmit": true
  }
}
```

Now we will add `tsup` to our project it bundles up our typescript project and converts the ts files into js files.
```sh
npm i --save-dev tsup
```

Then we have to add a build script to our `package.json`.
```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup index.ts --format cjs,esm --dts"
  }
  ...
}
```

Now if we run `npm run build` we will endup with a dist folde with all of out type files and js files.

Now we have to add some more properties to our `package.json` file.
```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "module": "dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts"
  ...
}
```

To be more secure we will also add a list script.
```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "tsc"
  },
  ...
}
```

## Initialize github

```sh
git init
```

```sh
touch .gitignore
```
```gitignore title=".gitignore"
node_modules
dist
```
```sh
git add .
```
```sh
git commit -m "init"
```

Then push the changes to remote repo.

## Setup Changesets

Changesets take out all of the pain of versioning our package.

```sh
npm i --save-dev @changesets/cli
```

Then run
```sh
npx changeset init
```

Now every time you change anything it requires a changeset which is a markdown file that will describe what changes are you making.
Now if you run `npx changeset` you will see following options.
```sh
ü¶ã  What kind of change is this for test_npm_package? (current version is 0.0.1) ‚Ä¶ 
‚ùØ patch
  minor
  major
```

## Setup CI

It's really pain to manually rebuild and deploy all our work. So we will setup a github workflow that will do this for us.

For that create a file in `.github/workflows/main.yml` and paste the following.
```yml title="main.yml"
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "**"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 7
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16.x
          cache: "pnpm"

      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm run lint && pnpm run build
```

And also create a `publish.yml` in the same directory.
```yml title="publish.yml"
name: Publish
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [CI]
    branches: [main]
    types: [completed]

concurrency: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  publish:
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 7
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16.x
          cache: "pnpm"

      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Create Release Pull Request or Publish
        id: changesets
        uses: changesets/action@v1
        with:
          publish: pnpm run release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```
