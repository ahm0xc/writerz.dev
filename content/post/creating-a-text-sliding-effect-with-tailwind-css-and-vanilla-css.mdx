import TextSlidingEffect from "~/components/demo/text-sliding-effect";

This time we are going to create a text slide effect. The idea is to have a text that slides in from the bottom to the top. The sliding text will be a sequence of words that change one after the other. I will show you how to create this effect using Tailwind CSS and vanilla CSS. Here is a demo of what we will be creating:
<br />
<TextSlidingEffect />


### Vanilla CSS

The code below shows how to create the sliding text effect using vanilla CSS:
```html
<h1>
  Dive Into
  <span className="slider">
    <span className="slider__word">Ideas</span>
    <span className="slider__word">Tech</span>
    <span className="slider__word">Art</span>
  </span>
</h1>
```
```css
h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  color: #a3a3a3;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.slider {
  position: relative;
  height: 1em;
  width: 150px;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin-left: 12px;
}

.slider__word {
  font-weight: 500;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  line-height: 1em;
  transform: translateY(100%);
  animation: slide 2.5s linear infinite;
  color: #f5f5f5;
}

.slider__word:nth-child(2) {
  animation-delay: 0.83s;
}

.slider__word:nth-child(3) {
  animation-delay: 1.67s;
}

@keyframes slide {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(100%);
    opacity: 0.1;
  }
  15% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  30% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  45% {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
    opacity: 0.1;
  }
}
```

Here is the code breakdown:

- The `h1` selector styles the "Dive into" text. The display property is set to `flex` to allow the elements within it to sit in a row.
- The `.slider` class is the container for the sliding words. It is set to relative position which acts as the reference point for the absolutely positioned child elements (sliding words). The `overflow` is set to `hidden` to hide the parts of the sliding words that are outside this container. We add a `margin-left` to the container to create some space between the "Dive into" text and the sliding words (and simulate a space between the words).
- The `.slider__word` class applies to the individual words that are sliding. Each word is absolutely positioned within the slider container. The transform: `translateY(100%);` means each word starts from below the visible area of the slider container. We use the `animation` property to set the name, duration, timing function and iteration count.
- The `:nth-child(2)` and `:nth-child(3)` selectors apply to the second and third word respectively. They each have an animation-delay to ensure the words do not all start animating at the same time. The specific timing of 0.83s and 1.67s for the `animation-delay` is to divide the total animation duration of 2.5s into three equal intervals, providing a smooth transition between each word in the sequence. This way, when one word finishes its animation, the next one is ready to start, creating a continuous, seamless animation.
- The `@keyframes` slide rule defines the animation. It specifies the styles at different stages (0%, 15%, 30%, 45%, 100%) of one cycle of the animation. The `transform: translateY();` is used to move the words vertically and opacity is used to fade them in and out.

### Tailwind CSS

If you prefer Tailwind CSS, here is the code:
```html
<h1 className="flex items-center text-6xl font-medium text-neutral-400">
  Dive Into
  <span className="relative ml-3 h-[1em] w-36 overflow-hidden">
    <span
      className="absolute h-full w-full -translate-y-full animate-slide leading-none text-white"
    >
      Ideas
    </span>
    <span
      className="absolute h-full w-full -translate-y-full animate-slide leading-none text-white [animation-delay:0.83s]"
    >
      Tech
    </span>
    <span
      className="absolute h-full w-full -translate-y-full animate-slide leading-none text-white [animation-delay:1.83s]"
    >
      Art
    </span>
  </span>
</h1>
```
```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        slide: "slide 2.5s linear infinite",
      },
      keyframes: {
        slide: {
          "0%": { transform: "translateY(100%)", opacity: 0.1 },
          "15%": { transform: "translateY(0)", opacity: 1 },
          "30%": { transform: "translateY(0)", opacity: 1 },
          "45%": { transform: "translateY(-100%)", opacity: 1 },
          "100%": { transform: "translateY(-100%)", opacity: 0.1 },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
