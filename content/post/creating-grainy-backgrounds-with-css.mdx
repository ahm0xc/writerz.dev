<Demo />

Hey there! Today, we're going to dive into a fun and simple way to add a bit of texture to your web designs - by creating grainy or noise backgrounds using CSS. This effect can add a subtle touch of depth and texture to your interfaces, making them stand out in a unique way. We'll be using SVGs, which means you can easily integrate this effect into any project.

### Grainy Background

Here is the final result we'll be creating and the difference without the grainy background. (You can view more example at the end of the article).

You can see the difference is subtle, but it adds a nice touch of depth to the card.

#### How it works
Here is the code:

```jsx
const CardGrainyBackground = () => {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <div className="card-content">
        <span className="icon">
          <svg
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
            fill="none"
            viewBox="0 0 24 24"
            stroke="currentColor"
            aria-hidden="true"
          />
        </span>
        <h3 className="title">Hello!</h3>
        <p className="description">
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Impedit ex
          obcaecati natus eligendi delectus, cum deleniti sunt in labore nihil
          quod quibusdam expedita nemo.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
```css
.card {
  height: 100%;
  width: 320px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 24px;
  background: rgb(15 23 42);
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
  display: flex;
}

.card-content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.card:before {
  content: "";
  background-color: transparent;
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 600 600'%3E%3Cfilter id='a'%3E%3CfeTurbulence type='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='.65' numOctaves='3' stitchTiles='stitch'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23a)'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
  background-repeat: repeat;
  background-size: 182px;
  opacity: 0.12;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.icon {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  display: inline-flex;
}

.icon > svg {
  border-radius: 0.375rem;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  display: inline-flex;
  background: #2563eb;
}

.title {
  font-size: 16px;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  color: #fff;
}

.description {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: rgb(148 163 184);
}
```

Let's break it down.

- The `:before` pseudo-element is used to create a layer on top of the .card element. This layer is filled with the SVG noise pattern that gives the grainy effect.

- The `content: "";` line is necessary for the `:before` pseudo-element to work. It's set to an empty string because we don't want to add any actual content, we just want to create a new box in the document tree that we can style.

- The `background-color: transparent;` line ensures that the background color of the pseudo-element doesn't block the view of the .card element behind it.

- SVG Filters: The grainy effect is created using an SVG filter. SVG filters provide various graphical operations such as blurring, lighting, and color adjustments. In this case, the `feTurbulence` filter is used, which generates Perlin or fractal noise. This filter is applied to a rectangle that covers the entire SVG.

Here is our svg:

- Background Image: The SVG filter is then converted into a data URL and set as the background image of the card. This is done using the `background-image` CSS property. The url() function is used to include the SVG data URL. To convert the SVG filter into a data URL, you can use a tool like [SVG to Data URI](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/).

- Background Properties: The background-repeat property is set to repeat, which means the background image will be repeated to cover the entire card. The background-size property is set to 182px, which controls the size of the background image.

- Opacity: The opacity property is set to 0.1, which makes the grainy effect subtle. You can increase or decrease the opacity to make the effect more or less prominent.

- Positioning: The grainy effect is positioned absolutely with respect to the card. This is done using the position: absolute property. The top and left properties are set to 0, which positions the grainy effect at the top-left corner of the card.

- Card Content: The card content is positioned relative to the card. This is done using the position: relative property. The z-index property is set to 1, which ensures that the card content is displayed above the grainy effect.

The rest of the CSS is for styling the card and its content, including the icon, title, and description.
